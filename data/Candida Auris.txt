Candida Auris
Overview
What is Candida auris?
Candida auris (C. auris) is a fungus that can cause serious illness. Some strains are resistant to multiple drugs, making them hard to treat. It most commonly spreads in hospitals or long-term care facilities. It can cause:
- Ear infections.
- Wound infections.
- Urinary tract infections (UTIs).
- Infections in your blood that spread to the rest of your body.
Unlike other species (types) of Candida, experts don’t think C. auris lives naturally on your body. You get it from contaminated surfaces or from other people who have a C. auris infection.
Most people without underlying health conditions aren’t at risk for C. auris infections.
How common are Candida auris infections?
C. auris infections are rare. However, they’re considered an emerging infectious disease, as healthcare providers have had an increase in cases since around 2019. Providers are taking additional steps to prevent the spread of C. auris in hospitals and long-term care facilities.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of a Candida auris infection?
Symptoms of a C. auris infection depend on where in your body the fungus infects. Some symptoms could include:
- Fever.
- Chills.
- Lethargy (extreme tiredness).
- Low blood pressure.
- High heart rate (tachycardia).
- Low body temperature (hypothermia).
- Pain, pressure or feeling of fullness in your ear (C. auris ear infection).
Since many people who get C. auris infections are already seriously ill, symptoms of C. auris may not be noticeable. Many people carrying C. auris don’t have symptoms but can still pass it to someone else.
How is Candida auris transmitted?
You get a C. auris infection from contact with someone who has it (even if they have no symptoms) or from a contaminated surface. In healthcare settings, infections can pass from person to person or through contaminated medical equipment. It can also infect you through a medical device in your body (like a central venous line or breathing tube).
Can Candida auris spread through the air?
No, experts don’t believe C. auris spreads through the air. It’s usually carried on your skin and travels from person to person or through contaminated objects.
What are the risk factors for Candida auris infections?
Most people who contract C. auris infections have a weakened immune system from an underlying health condition. You might be at a higher risk if you have:
- A central venous line, breathing tube, feeding tube, bladder catheter or another device that goes into your body. These can allow C. auris to get into your body from the outside.
- A blood cancer or diabetes.
- Been in a hospital or another healthcare facility for a long time.
- Had surgery recently.
- Been on antibiotics for a long time, or use them frequently.
What are the complications of Candida auris infections?
If C. auris spreads to your blood, it can cause serious complications, including:
- Sepsis.
- Shock.
- Organ failure.
Diagnosis and Tests
How are Candida auris infections diagnosed?
C. auris can be difficult to diagnose. It requires special testing and is sometimes mistaken for other infectious diseases. Your provider may think you have a C. auris infection if you have symptoms of a bacterial infection that don’t go away with antibiotics. They may test samples from your body for C. auris, including:
- Blood.
- Pee (urine).
- Poop (stool).
- Fluid or tissue from a wound.
- A swab from your groin, armpits, ears, vagina or rectum.
Management and Treatment
Can a Candida auris infection be cured?
A type of medication called echinocandins can usually cure a Candida auris infection. But some types of C. auris are becoming resistant to medications, making them harder to treat. Providers may need to use a combination of medications to get rid of the infection.
Prevention
Can C. auris be prevented?
Healthcare providers follow safety and sterilization rules to prevent healthcare-acquired infections like C. auris. These include:
- Handwashing.
- Disinfecting surfaces.
- Ensuring that people only take antibiotics when they have bacterial infections.
- Sterilizing medical devices.
- Screening patients and visitors to healthcare facilities when there’s a suspected outbreak.
- Quarantining (isolating) people with C. auris infections so it doesn’t spread to other people.
You can help prevent C. auris infections by washing your hands frequently, especially if you’re caring for someone with a weakened immune system or who’s spent a long time in a healthcare facility recently. You can also ask your provider how long you need to use invasive medical devices like catheters.
Outlook / Prognosis
What is the mortality rate of Candida auris infections?
Since most people who get C. auris already have serious underlying health conditions that have an increased risk of mortality, the true mortality rate of C. auris is hard to know. Some limited studies show the rate as high as 30% to 60%.
Additional Common Questions
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Even when you’re in the hospital, communication with your healthcare team is important. Let them know if you’re experiencing symptoms of an infection, like pain, rapid heartrate, weakness or fever.
What questions should I ask my doctor?
It might be helpful to ask your healthcare provider:
- What are my treatment options?
- When can I expect to feel better?
- How did I get this infection?
- What can I do to prevent an infection like this in the future?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Candida auris infections are rare but serious. Your healthcare providers work to keep hospitals and long-term care facilities safe. Most people don’t need to worry about Candida auris. It usually doesn’t cause an infection in people with healthy immune systems. Don’t hesitate to speak up to a provider if you’re concerned about C. auris for yourself or a loved one in their care. They can answer any questions you have about C. auris prevention.
