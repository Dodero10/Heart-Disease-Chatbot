Candida Parapsilosis
Overview
What is Candida parapsilosis?
Candida parapsilosis (C. parapsilosis) is a type of fungus that lives on your skin and in your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It’s also found in the environment around us (like in soil).
Most of the time, C. parapsilosis doesn’t harm us. But surgery, injury or disease can cause it to grow in places it doesn’t belong. This can give you an infection and make you seriously ill. Infections in your blood or internal organs with C. parapsilosis (or other forms of Candida fungi) are called invasive candidiasis.
C. parapsilosis can cause:
- Inflammation of the lining of your heart valves and chambers (endocarditis).
- Inflammation of the lining of your abdomen (peritonitis).
- Wound infections.
- Nail infections (onychomycosis).
- Infections in your blood that spread to the rest of your body.
Rarely, it can also cause:
- Meningitis.
- Arthritis.
- Ear infections.
- Vaginitis.
- Urinary tract infections.
How common is Candida parapsilosis?
C. parapsilosis is one of the most common fungal infections that causes serious illness (the most common is Candida albicans). But that doesn’t mean you’re likely to get it — about 9 in 100,000 people (or a little less than .01% of people) get invasive candidiasis each year.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of a Candida parapsilosis infection?
Symptoms of a C. parapsilosis infection depend on where in your body the fungus infects. Some symptoms could include:
- Fever.
- Chills.
- Shortness of breath.
- Cough.
- Abdominal pain.
- Redness, swelling or itching at a surgical or injury site.
How do you get Candida parapsilosis?
Most of the time, C. parapsilosis lives on your skin or in your intestinal tract (gut). Like dozens of other types of fungi, they live on or in your body without harming you. But if they get into a place they shouldn’t be, they’ll start reproducing and cause an infection. This can happen if you have a deep wound or surgical incision, or if you have a medical device in your body (like a central venous line or breathing tube) that’s contaminated with the fungus.
What are the risk factors for a Candida parapsilosis infection?
Newborns and people with certain medical conditions are at higher risk for C. parapsilosis infections. You might be at higher risk if you:
- Have a weakened immune system from an underlying health condition. This includes having HIV, blood cancers or diabetes, or receiving an organ or stem cell transplant. These conditions make it harder for your body to fight off infections.
- Have a central venous line, breathing tube, feeding tube or other device that goes into your body. These can allow C. parapsilosis to get into your body from the outside.
- Have had abdominal surgery recently. C. parapsilosis lives in your intestinal tract and can get into other parts of your body through surgery.
- Have been on antibiotics for a long time or use them frequently. “Good” (non-harmful) bacteria in your gut prevent other bacteria and fungi like C. parapsilosis from growing out of control. Antibiotics can kill good bacteria, putting you at risk for fungal infections.
- Inject nonmedical drugs. C. parapsilosis can get into your blood through contaminated needles.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is Candida parapsilosis diagnosed?
A provider diagnoses C. parapsilosis by testing a sample of your blood or affected tissue. Tell them about any implanted medical devices you have or recent surgeries.
Management and Treatment
How is Candida parapsilosis treated?
Healthcare providers treat C. parapsilosis with antifungal medications. These might include:
- Echinocandins, like caspofungin.
- Fluconazole or other azoles.
- Amphotericin B.
Prevention
Can C. parapsilosis be prevented?
Healthcare providers follow safety and sterilization rules to prevent healthcare-acquired infections like C. parapsilosis. These include:
- Washing their hands.
- Disinfecting surfaces.
- Ensuring that people only take antibiotics when they have bacterial infections.
- Sterilizing medical devices.
You can help prevent C. parapsilosis infections by:
- Washing your hands frequently, especially if you’re caring for someone with a weakened immune system.
- Asking your provider how long you need to use invasive medical devices like catheters and how to prevent infection while you need the device.
- Asking your provider about preventative antifungals if you have a weakened immune system.
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have C. parapsilosis?
Invasive C. parapsilosis infections are serious. You’ll be treated in the hospital with antifungals. Providers will monitor you closely while you recover.
What’s the mortality rate of C. parapsilosis infections?
As many people with C. parapsilosis have underlying health conditions, it can be hard to know the mortality (death) rate. Experts estimate the mortality rate for invasive candidiasis (caused by all types of Candida) to be around 25% — or 1 in 4 people with the infection.
Additional Common Questions
When should I see my healthcare provider?
If you have an implanted medical device or a weakened immune system or have had a recent surgery, ask your healthcare provider what signs of infection you should look out for. Follow up with your provider if you have any concerning symptoms.
When should I go to the ER?
Go to the emergency room if you have any signs of severe illness, including:
- Fever over 103 degrees Fahrenheit or 40 degrees Celsius.
- Severe pain.
- Seizures.
- Confusion or disorientation.
- Sudden drop in blood pressure (symptoms include weakness, dizziness and fainting).
What questions should I ask my doctor?
It might be helpful to ask your healthcare provider:
- What are my treatment options?
- When can I expect to feel better?
- How did I get this infection?
- What can I do to prevent an infection like this in the future?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Harmless fungi live on and inside your body. But sometimes, they can get into parts of your body where they’re not supposed to be and make you sick. Seek medical attention right away if you have symptoms of an invasive fungal infection. Let your healthcare providers know about any medical conditions or devices you have or if you’ve had surgery recently. This information can help them get to the bottom of your symptoms more quickly and treat any infections as soon as possible.
