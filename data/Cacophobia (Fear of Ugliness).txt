Cacophobia (Fear of Ugliness)
Overview
What is cacophobia?
Cacophobia is an intense fear of ugliness. The condition is a specific phobia (fear), which is a type of anxiety disorder.
People with cacophobia might be afraid of looking ugly themselves, or they might worry about seeing something they consider to be ugly. A person with cacophobia might fear all forms of ugliness or a specific kind, such as perceived ugliness in people, animals, places or objects.
People with cacophobia can get very stressed or anxious when they think about or see something they consider to be ugly. The condition can also affect personal and professional relationships. People with this condition may understand that their fear is extreme, but may not be able to control it.
What are people with cachophobia afraid of?
Most phobias are objective, meaning they have to do with things that are indisputable. For example, being afraid of snakes is objective because the definition of snake can not be disputed. A snake is clearly a snake.
But cacophobia is subjective. An individual with cacophobia determines what is ugly and what is not. One person with cacophobia may be terrified of a certain “ugly” object, but another person with cacophobia might not react at all to the same thing.
How common is fear of ugliness?
It’s hard to know exactly how many people have a specific phobia, like cacohobia (fear of ugliness). Many people may keep this fear to themselves or may not recognize they have it. We do know that about 1 in 10 American adults and 1 in 5 teenagers will deal with a specific phobia disorder at some point in their lives.
Symptoms and Causes
What causes a fear of ugliness?
Mental health professionals aren’t sure what causes specific phobias, such as cacophobia. But most believe it is caused by a combination of:
- Environment: Some people are raised in a way that emphasizes the way things and people look. This can develop into certain behaviors and fears.
- Genetics: Some people have a family history of anxiety and specific fears.
- Traumatic experiences: Life experiences may lead to cacophobia. One example is a parent who tells a child repeatedly that the child is ugly. Another example is a childhood bully making fun of the way someone looks.
What are the symptoms of cacophobia?
A person with cacophobia may experience anxiety symptoms when they think about or encounter something they consider to be ugly:
- Chills.
- Dizziness and lightheadedness.
- Excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis).
- Heart palpitations.
- Nausea.
- Shortness of breath (dyspnea).
- Trembling or shaking.
- Upset stomach or indigestion (dyspepsia).
People with cacophobia may also demonstrate certain behaviors:
- Avoiding places and situations in which they might encounter ugliness. This may involve skipping important educational, professional or personal activities.
- Criticizing self (low self-esteem) and others excessively.
- Spending a lot of time and money on beauty treatments and even surgeries to avoid looking ugly.
- Taking a long time getting ready or trying to fix themselves up.
- Worrying excessively about the possibility that they are ugly.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is cacophobia diagnosed?
There are no tests to diagnose specific fears. A healthcare provider can diagnose the condition based on discussions with you about:
- Their symptoms.
- How long they’ve been happening.
- Whether they’re interfering in your life.
A healthcare provider can diagnose cacophobia if your fear of ugliness:
- Causes extreme anxiety.
- Leads to significant stress or affects your daily life.
- Has been happening for at least six months.
- Leads you to take unreasonable steps in an attempt to look more beautiful.
- Makes you avoid specific situations where you think you might encounter ugliness.
- Produces physical symptoms of anxiety or panic attacks.
Management and Treatment
What are the treatments for cacophobia?
People with mild cacophobia may not need treatment. But if the fear causes physical symptoms or affects your life, you should talk to a healthcare provider.
Possible treatments for cacophobia include:
- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT is structured psychotherapy that can help a person understand and control thoughts and emotions. This talk therapy can help people unlearn negative thoughts that happen when they think about or encounter ugliness. One type of CBT is dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). With DBT, a therapist asks the person to think about something ugly and then half-smile. Over time, this may change the emotions associated with perceived ugliness.
- Exposure therapy: Exposure therapy, sometimes called desensitization, helps people confront their fears. The therapy exposes a person to things they fear — gradually, over time, in a controlled environment. Exposure therapy starts with something less scary, like a picture of something mildly ugly. Through increased exposure, people can learn to manage cacophobia.
- Hypnotherapy: Hypnotherapy can put a person in a trance-like but focused state. A person under hypnosis is more open to suggestions and change. A hypnotist may be able to convince a hypnotized person that something they thought was ugly is not. Or perhaps the hypnotist can convince the person that ugliness is not to be feared.
- Medications: Antianxiety medications can lessen anxiety and its symptoms. The drugs are not a cure for cacophobia. But they can help people face certain situations when necessary.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Cacophobia is an anxiety disorder that involves intense, irrational fear of ugliness. People with the condition may worry about being ugly themselves or encountering something they consider to be ugly. The fear is subjective, meaning the individual determines what is ugly and frightening. Untreated cacophobia may lead to other disorders, so it’s important to talk to a healthcare provider.
