Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia
Overview
What is multifocal atrial tachycardia?
Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) is a condition in which you have multiple abnormal signals from your heart’s upper chambers. These electric signals create a fast, irregular heart rhythm. Like other types of atrial tachycardia, your heart rate is more than 100 beats per minute. It can go up to 150 beats per minute with MAT.
Chaotic atrial tachycardia is another name for this condition.
What is the difference between atrial fibrillation and multifocal atrial tachycardia?
Both conditions are abnormal heart rhythms that happen in your heart’s upper chambers. Often, people get an atrial fibrillation diagnosis when they have multifocal atrial tachycardia. Your provider can tell the difference between them on your electrocardiogram results. They’ll look at the P waves that show when your atria contract.
About half of people who have MAT develop atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.
Who does multifocal atrial tachycardia affect?
Adults with an average age of 70 usually get this condition. However, it can affect children as well. Generally, people are acutely ill when they have MAT.
How common is multifocal atrial tachycardia?
This is a rare type of abnormal heart rhythm. Less than 1% of all arrhythmias are this type.
How does multifocal atrial tachycardia affect my body?
When your heart pumps too often, it doesn’t have time to move much blood into its four chambers. Oxygen-poor blood moves through your heart’s chambers before going to your lungs for oxygen. After picking up oxygen, it goes through your heart and out to your body.
With only a short time between pumps, the amount of blood in each chamber is smaller than it should be. That means a smaller amount of blood than normal can go to your body’s cells with each heartbeat.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of multifocal atrial tachycardia?
Most people don’t have symptoms of multifocal atrial tachycardia. However, you may have symptoms of the problem that’s causing it.
Multifocal atrial tachycardia symptoms may include:
- Chest pain.
- Palpitations.
- Shortness of breath.
- Fainting.
What causes multifocal atrial tachycardia?
Most people (60% to 85%) who have multifocal atrial tachycardia have lung disease. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the most common issue connected to this type of abnormal heart rhythm.
Other causes include:
- Respiratory failure.
- Infection.
- Coronary artery disease.
- Heart failure.
- Low levels of potassium, magnesium or sodium.
- Cancer.
- Diabetes.
- Major surgery.
- Kidney failure.
- Pulmonary embolism (rare).
- Heart valve disease (rare).
Diagnosis and Tests
How is multifocal atrial tachycardia diagnosed?
Healthcare providers usually discover multifocal atrial tachycardia on an electrocardiogram (EKG) reading.
What tests will be done to diagnose multifocal atrial tachycardia?
An electrocardiogram (EKG) is the only test a provider needs to make a MAT diagnosis.
After diagnosing you with multifocal atrial tachycardia, a provider may order:
- A chest X-ray.
- Blood tests.
- An echocardiogram (rarely).
Management and Treatment
How is multifocal atrial tachycardia treated?
Many people with multifocal atrial tachycardia only need treatment for the condition that caused it. MAT usually goes away once you get treatment for the cause. If you have multifocal atrial tachycardia, you may already be in the hospital because of respiratory failure. Your provider will give you treatment for that.
Multifocal atrial tachycardia treatment for your arrhythmia may include:
- Beta-blockers like metoprolol (Lopressor® or Toprol®XL).
- Magnesium and potassium.
- Verapamil (Verelan® or Calan®) or diltiazem (Diltzac® or Cardizem®), which are calcium channel blockers.
Rarely, someone with multifocal atrial tachycardia may need AV node ablation and a pacemaker.
Side effects of the treatment
Medications for MAT may cause:
- Dizziness.
- Headache.
- Upset stomach.
- Diarrhea.
- Constipation.
Prevention
How can I reduce my risk?
Keeping your heart or lung issues from getting worse can reduce your risk of multifocal atrial tachycardia.
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have multifocal atrial tachycardia?
You should be able to go home from the hospital once you’ve had successful treatment for the condition that caused your multifocal atrial tachycardia.
How long multifocal atrial tachycardia lasts
Multifocal atrial tachycardia usually goes away once you get treatment for what’s causing it.
Outlook for multifocal atrial tachycardia
Your prognosis depends on the condition that caused your multifocal atrial tachycardia. Because these conditions can be severe, 30% to 60% of people with multifocal atrial tachycardia die during their hospital stay. The conditions that cause the tachycardia (not the abnormal rhythm itself) can be fatal.
Living With
How do I take care of myself?
You may need to take a beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker for a while. This only happens to 25% of those who have multifocal atrial tachycardia.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
You’ll need to go to follow-up appointments for the issue that caused your multifocal atrial tachycardia. If it’s a long-term condition, you’ll need regular appointments to make sure it’s under control.
What questions should I ask my doctor?
- How long do I need to take the medicine you prescribed for me?
- What is the prognosis for my specific situation?
- Can I get multifocal atrial tachycardia again?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Because most people don’t have symptoms of multifocal atrial tachycardia, it may surprise you to know you have it. But it’s more important for your provider to treat the cause of your abnormal heart rhythm, which is usually a lung disease. Follow your provider’s instructions to help yourself get well. Be sure to ask questions if you don’t understand your condition or treatment. Once your condition improves, your abnormal heart rhythm should, too.
