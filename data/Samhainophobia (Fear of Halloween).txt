What does the word samhain mean?
The word samhain comes from the festival of Samhain, first celebrated by the Celtic druids about 2,000 years ago. The Celts mainly lived in the region that is now Ireland, Northern France and the United Kingdom.
The Celts believed that the living and the dead mingled on Oct. 31, the night before the Celtic New Year. The festival included large bonfires, where they sacrificed animals to please the dead. The Celts often wore costumes made of animal skins and heads.

Diagnosis and Tests
How is samhainophobia diagnosed?
If samhainophobia disrupts your life, your healthcare provider may recommend visiting a mental health professional like a psychologist. The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) doesn’t recognize samhainophobia as a phobic disorder. But a psychologist may make a diagnosis after evaluating your symptoms.
You may have a specific phobic disorder if the fear of Halloween:
- Occurs when you experience situations related to Halloween.
- Leads to you avoiding anything to do with Halloween.
- Causes you to miss out on social events.
- Impacts your ability to enjoy life.
- Triggers symptoms of anxiety or fear that don’t match the actual danger.
- Lasts at least six months.
Management and Treatment
What are samhainophobia treatments?
Exposure therapy is one of the main treatments for samhainophobia. During exposure therapy, a mental health professional exposes you to situations and images that may trigger your symptoms. As many as 9 in 10 people with specific phobias see their symptoms improve after getting this type of psychotherapy (talk therapy).
During exposure therapy, you:
- Learn breathing and relaxation techniques to use before and during an exposure.
- View images or videos of situations involving Halloween.
- Gradually progress to visiting a store with a display of Halloween items.
- Finally may attend a Halloween party with a friend or relative who can support you.
What are other samhainophobia solutions?
Other techniques to overcome samhainophobia include:
- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): Many providers suggest CBT along with exposure therapy. CBT helps you learn to change the way you see and respond to situations that trigger symptoms.
- Hypnotherapy: Healthcare providers use guided relaxation techniques and focused attention to help change your perception of situations. Providers can also use hypnotherapy to find the underlying cause of your anxiety.
- Medications: Anti-anxiety drugs may be helpful if you’re worried about having symptoms during upcoming Halloween events. Your provider may suggest beta blockers (to reduce your anxiety during specific events, such as Halloween parties.
- Relaxation techniques: Practicing deep breathing can help you take in more oxygen and reduce anxious feelings. You can start by breathing in for three seconds and breathing out for six seconds.
What are the complications of samhainophobia?
Severe samhainophobia can impact your quality of life. You may not want to attend social events, go shopping or even leave the house during the period around Halloween. It can be difficult to see friends and family during this time.
Children with samhainophobia may not want to go to school. They may refuse to go trick-or-treating or to go to Halloween-related events with their friends.
Some people experience panic attacks, which can lead to noncardiac chest pain and a racing heart rate. Constant worries about having panic attacks can result in a panic disorder that may require the long-term use of anti-anxiety medications.
