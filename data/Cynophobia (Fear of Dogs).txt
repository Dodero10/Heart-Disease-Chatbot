Cynophobia (Fear of Dogs)
Overview
What is cynophobia?
Cynophobia is an extreme fear of dogs. The name of this phobia comes from “cyno,” the Greek word for dog. Children and adults with this disorder go out of their way to avoid dogs. They may have severe anxiety or a full panic attack when hearing a dog bark, watching a movie about a dog or going to a place where a dog might be.
In severe cases, people with this disorder avoid friends or stay indoors because they worry about meeting a dog. Several types of therapy can help people with this phobia.
What is a phobia?
Phobias are anxiety disorders that cause people to be afraid of a situation or object that is usually harmless. They involve excessive fear of an event or situation that won’t necessarily cause harm in reality. And they tend to have unexpected reactions to things other people don’t find scary or worrisome.
Cynophobia is a specific phobia disorder. People with specific phobia disorders have extreme reactions to a certain object or situation. They do whatever they can to avoid the thing that causes discomfort, concern or fear — in this case, dogs.
How common is cynophobia?
Healthcare providers aren’t sure how many people have this particular phobia. Some studies show that intense fear of animals is one of the most common types of specific phobias. And about 1 in every 3 people with a phobia of animals has an overwhelming fear of dogs.
Around 9% of adults in the U.S. have a specific phobia disorder. People of all genders can get specific phobia disorders, but women are more likely to get them.
Symptoms and Causes
Who is at risk of cynophobia?
This disorder commonly affects children, but people of all ages can develop cynophobia. Cynophobia is widespread among people with autism and sensory or intellectual differences. You’re more likely to have cynophobia if you have:
- Depression.
- Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).
- A history of mental illness, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic attacks or panic disorder.
- Other phobias or a history of phobias in your family.
- Substance abuse disorder.
People who have had a scary encounter with a dog are also more likely to develop this phobia. Even if the dog didn’t actually bite you, being chased or threatened can cause cynophobia. The terrifying memories can return whenever you think about or see a dog. This phobia can develop as part of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
What causes cynophobia?
Providers think that phobias result from a mix of genetics, personal history and environmental factors. People who have anxiety disorders or mental illnesses are more likely to develop a phobia. They may be more vulnerable to developing cynophobia if they have a scary experience with a dog or another animal.
What are the triggers of cynophobia?
People with this disorder don’t necessarily need to come into contact with a dog to have severe anxiety. Triggers of cynophobia include:
- Seeing a dog, even if the dog is on a leash or in an enclosure.
- Hearing a dog bark or growl.
- Seeing a picture or watching a movie containing a dog.
- Thinking about a dog or thinking about going someplace where a dog might be.
What are the symptoms of cynophobia?
People with this phobia experience extreme anxiety, fear and panic attacks when they think about or see a dog. They feel as if they’re in danger. Signs of cynophobia include:
- Crying, screaming, panic and other intense emotions.
- Difficulty swallowing or feeling like you’re choking.
- Dizziness, dry mouth and headaches.
- Excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis).
- Feelings of dread and/or catastrophic thoughts (feeling like something terrible will happen).
- Increased heart rate, chest pain or heart palpitations.
- Nausea and vomiting.
- Diarrhea.
- Shortness of breath (dyspnea) or fast breathing.
Diagnosis and Tests
How do healthcare providers diagnose cynophobia?
Your provider will ask about your symptoms and ask when they occur. They will also ask about your history and your family history of phobias. They’ll want to know about any scary experiences you’ve had with dogs or other animals. Tell your provider when your symptoms began and if they affect your sleep and daily activities.
Your provider may refer you to a mental health professional who specializes in phobias. This type of expert is specially trained to diagnose phobias and other anxiety disorders.
Management and Treatment
How do providers treat cynophobia?
The primary treatments for cynophobia are therapy and medication. There are several types of therapy that can help people with an overwhelming fear of dogs. These include:
Exposure therapy: Your provider gradually exposes you to dogs. Some providers offer virtual reality therapy using special goggles that mimic interacting with a real dog. Over time, your sensitivity to dogs decreases and you become less fearful. This therapy may include:
- Closing your eyes and imagining an encounter with a dog.
- Seeing pictures or videos of dogs.
- Holding a toy dog.
- Watching dogs play from a distance and slowly getting closer to the dog.
- Petting a dog while it’s on a leash.
- Spending time with a dog off of a leash.
Your provider may also recommend:
- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to change the way you respond to fear and think about dogs in a different way.
- Psychotherapy, or talk therapy, to help you understand your fears.
- Hypnotherapy, which includes guided relaxation exercises while your mind is in a calm state. This allows you to rethink your fear of dogs and the anxiety it causes.
- Mindfulness exercises, yoga, breathing exercises and meditation to help you control anxiety.
- Medications to treat depression, relieve anxiety or control panic attacks.
What are the complications of cynophobia?
Without treatment, severe cynophobia can cause people to avoid situations where they may encounter dogs. They might stay away from family and friends or stop going for walks outside. They may even develop agoraphobia and stop leaving their home altogether. This can damage relationships and lead to problems holding down a job. Isolation, anxiety and depression can result.
Outlook / Prognosis
What is the prognosis (outlook) for people who have cynophobia?
Most people with a phobia of dogs get better with therapy. But the outlook depends on the severity of the phobia and the person’s overall mental health. Some people need long-term therapy for the condition to improve. You may also need several therapies, like CBT combined with exposure therapy.
Living With

A note from Cleveland ClinicIf you or your child is going out of your way to avoid dogs, or if anxiety and panic attacks are causing you distress, talk to your provider. When cynophobia is severe, it can have a significant impact on your quality of life. Therapy can help you learn to control your response to fear and think about dogs in a different way. Relaxation techniques and meditation are beneficial to people with cynophobia. Be sure to tell your provider if you have other phobias or a history of mental illness in your family.
