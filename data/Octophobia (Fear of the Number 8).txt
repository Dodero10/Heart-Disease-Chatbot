Octophobia (Fear of the Number 8)
Overview
What is octophobia?
When you have a specific phobia (a type of anxiety disorder), it means you’re fearful of something that isn’t likely to harm you. Octophobia is an intense fear of the number 8 (eight).
People with octophobia experience anxiety when they think about or see the number 8. They may go to great lengths to avoid the number, including:
- Never going anywhere that has 8 in the address or on a street sign.
- Obsess about making sure that grocery receipts or restaurant tabs don’t add up to a total that includes the number 8.
- Try not to own eight of any particular item, such as eight shirts.
Numbers are everywhere, so octophobia can cause significant stress and even physical symptoms. A person with octophobia may understand that the fear isn’t reasonable, but they can’t control it. It may interfere with personal relationships, work responsibilities or everyday tasks (for example, paying bills and knowing what time it is).
How common is fear of the number 8?
It’s hard knowing exactly how many people have a specific phobia, like octophobia. We do know that about 1 in 10 American adults and 1 in 5 teenagers will deal with a specific phobia disorder at some point in their lives, though.
Are there other fears related to octophobia?
Octophobia is related to other fears involving numbers, including:
- Arithmophobia, also called numerophobia, which involves fear of numbers or math.
- Triskaidekaphobia, fear of the number 13, which is more common in the United States than octophobia is.
- Hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia, fear of the number 666, which is associated with the devil.
Symptoms and Causes
What causes a fear of the number 8?
Healthcare providers aren’t sure what causes specific phobias, such as octophobia. But they believe it’s often caused by some combination of:
- Genetics: A person with a family history of anxiety and specific fears may be more likely to have phobias.
- Superstitions and cultural meanings: Some cultures pass down stories and traditions that involve the number 8. It’s often related to power, religion or gods. The number 8 represents the number of Wiccan festivals of the year and the number of days in the Jewish Hanukkah. It also has significance in Islam and Hinduism. Turned on its side, the number is the sign for infinity.
- Traumatic experiences associated with the number: Someone may develop octophobia after a bad experience involving the number 8. Examples include being scolded or hit because of a bad math grade or having a traumatic experience in a house with 8 in the address.
What are the symptoms of octophobia?
A person with octophobia may experience symptoms of anxiety or panic when they think about or come across the number 8:
- Dizziness.
- Dry mouth.
- Extreme feeling of dread or terror.
- Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
- Profuse sweating.
- Rapid breathing and heart rate.
- Shaking or trembling.
- Shortness of breath.
Octophobia also might lead to certain behaviors, such as:
- Avoiding looking at things like street signs, clocks, computers, phones, books, bills or receipts.
- Skipping school or work because of the possibility of encountering the number 8.
- Staying home or never going out because of fear.
These behaviors can damage a person’s education, career and personal relationships, as well as lead to depression or substance abuse.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is octophobia diagnosed?
There aren’t any tests to diagnose fear of the number 8. But your healthcare provider can diagnose the phobia based on discussions with you about:
- Symptoms.
- How long they’ve been happening.
- Whether they’re interfering in your life.
Your healthcare provider can diagnose octophobia if you have an intense fear that:
- Causes extreme anxiety as soon as you think about or encounter the number 8.
- Leads to significant stress or affects your daily life.
- Has been happening for at least six months.
- Isn’t related to any actual danger.
- Makes you avoid certain situations or activities.
- Produces physical symptoms of anxiety or panic attacks.
Management and Treatment
How do I get rid of octophobia?
If fear of the number 8 is causing physical symptoms or interfering with daily life, talk to your healthcare provider. Treatments may help, such as:
- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT is a type of psychotherapy that can help you understand and control thoughts and emotions. This structured talk therapy can help you unlearn negative thoughts and behaviors.
- Exposure therapy: Exposure therapy, sometimes called desensitization, helps you confront your fears gradually. You’re exposed to the idea of the fear-causing number(s) over time in a controlled environment. Exposure therapy starts with something less scary, like looking at a picture of the number 8. You may be asked to imagine the number 8, hold eight of something and eventually draw the number. By increasing exposure to the number 8, you may learn to manage the specific fear and its symptoms.
- Hypnotherapy: Hypnotherapy can put you in a trance-like but focused state. Under hypnosis, you’re more open to suggestion and change. A hypnotist may be able to convince you that you’re less afraid of the number 8.
- Medications: A variety of anti-anxiety medications can lessen anxiety and its physical symptoms.
Prevention
How can I reduce my risk of octophobia?
Mental health professionals don’t fully understand what causes octophobia and other specific phobias, so there’s no proven way to prevent it.
But many people with one specific fear have multiple phobias, plus other anxiety disorders such as panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It’s important to work with your healthcare provider to manage any symptoms of the first anxiety disorder before you develop additional fears.
Outlook / Prognosis
Can octophobia be cured?
There isn’t a cure for specific fears such as octophobia. But exposure therapy, often combined with other treatments, helps most people who practice it regularly.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Octophobia is an intense, irrational fear of the number 8. It’s a type of specific phobia, which is a kind of anxiety disorder.
