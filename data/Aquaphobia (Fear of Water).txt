What other therapies may be used to treat aquaphobia?
Other therapies to overcome aquaphobia include:
- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT helps you learn to change how you see and respond to situations and objects that trigger symptoms. Many healthcare providers use CBT along with exposure therapy or hypnotherapy.
- Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT): This modified form of CBT teaches people how to live in the moment. It can help you cope with distress, maintain relationships with others and regulate emotions. You might have DBT in a group setting or one-on-one with a therapist.
- Hypnotherapy: Healthcare providers use guided relaxation techniques and focused attention to help alter how you look at water. They may also use hypnotherapy to find the underlying event that led to the development of your water anxiety.
- Medications: Anti-anxiety drugs and antidepressants may help reduce aquaphobia symptoms. Healthcare providers often prescribe these medications along with CBT. If aquaphobia causes fear at night that affects your sleep, your healthcare provider may recommend sleep aids.
- Yoga, mindfulness and meditation: A regular yoga practice can help you relax and reduce your stress. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) teaches you to relieve anxiety in the moment. Meditation can help you focus on your breathing to prevent panic attacks.
What are the complications of aquaphobia?
Severe aquaphobia can impact your quality of life. You may not want to take a bath or shower, which can affect your cleanliness and self-esteem. Your risk of disease may also increase if you don’t keep yourself clean.
The thought of meeting friends or family at a beach or swimming pool can cause extreme anxiety. You may stop wanting to leave your house at all and develop agoraphobia.
Some people with aquaphobia may have panic attacks. These attacks can lead to:
- Feeling dizzy or lightheaded.
- Feeling of impending doom.
- Nausea.
- Noncardiac chest pain.
- Racing heart rate.
