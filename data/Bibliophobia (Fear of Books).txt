Bibliophobia (Fear of Books)
Overview
What is bibliophobia?
Bibliophobia is an intense fear of books. The condition is a specific phobia (fear), which is a type of anxiety disorder.
A person with bibliophobia might fear all books or only a specific kind, such as textbooks or children’s books. Someone with bibliophobia might be afraid of books themselves, the stories they contain or the act of reading a book.
People with bibliophobia may:
- Avoid books and places where they might encounter books, such as schools, libraries and stores.
- Experience shame or embarrassment about the fear.
- Get nervous when they merely think about books.
- Panic when they have to hold a book or read a book.
- Skip educational, professional or personal activities that involve books.
- Worry excessively about the possibility of having to read or be near books.
A person with bibliophobia may understand that the fear is extreme, but not be able to control it.
Books are almost everywhere, and it’s difficult to avoid them in everyday life. Bibliophobia can cause significant stress and even physical symptoms. The condition can affect a person’s education, social experiences and career path.

Symptoms and Causes
What causes a fear of books?
Mental health professionals aren’t sure what causes specific phobias, such as bibliophobia. But most believe it’s caused by a combination of:
- Genetics: Some people have a family history of anxiety and specific fears.
- Learning disability: A learning disability such as dyslexia or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can cause stress and lead to fear of books.
- Traumatic experiences associated with books: This may include reading a scary book at a young age or being shamed while reading aloud to other people.
What are the symptoms of book phobia?
A person with bibliophobia may experience symptoms of anxiety or panic about books and reading, such as:
- Chills.
- Dizziness and lightheadedness.
- Excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis).
- Heart palpitations.
- Nausea.
- Shortness of breath (dyspnea).
- Trembling or shaking.
- Upset stomach or indigestion (dyspepsia).
Bibliophobia also might lead to certain behaviors, such as:
- Avoiding books, including schools, libraries, stores or even friends’ homes.
- Refusing to participate in activities that may involve books, like going to the library or shopping.
- Skipping school.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is bibliophobia diagnosed?
There aren’t any tests to diagnose fear of books. Your healthcare provider can diagnose the condition based on discussions with you about:
- Your symptoms.
- How long they’ve been happening.
- Whether they’re interfering in your life.
Your healthcare provider can diagnose bibliophobia if your fear of books:
- Causes extreme anxiety.
- Leads to significant stress or affects your daily life.
- Has been happening for at least six months.
- Is out of proportion with any actual danger.
- Makes you avoid books or specific situations that might involve books.
- Produces physical symptoms of anxiety or panic attacks.
Your healthcare provider also might recommend testing for a learning disability, which may be at the root of the phobia.
Management and Treatment
What are the treatments for bibliophobia?
People with mild bibliophobia may not need treatment. But the fear can cause physical symptoms, disrupt daily life and affect success in school and work. If that’s the case, you should talk to your healthcare provider.
Possible treatments include:
- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT is structured psychotherapy that can help you understand and control thoughts and perceptions. This talk therapy can help you unlearn negative thoughts that happen when you think about or encounter books. One type of CBT is dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). With DBT, your therapist asks you to think about a book and then half-smile. Over time, this may change your emotions associated with books.
- Exposure therapy: Exposure therapy, sometimes called desensitization, helps you confront your fears gradually. You’re exposed to the idea of books over time in a controlled environment. Exposure therapy starts with something less scary, like seeing a book in a place you feel safe. Eventually, you may be asked to hold a book, read a short excerpt and eventually visit a bookstore. Through increasing exposure, you can learn to manage bibliophobia.
- Hypnotherapy: Hypnotherapy can put you in a trance-like but focused state. Under hypnosis, you’re more open to suggestion and change. Your hypnotist may be able to convince you that you’re less afraid of books or reading.
- Medications: A variety of anti-anxiety medications can lessen anxiety and its symptoms. These drugs aren’t a cure for bibliophobia, but they may be able to help you face certain situations, such as finishing school or taking your children to the library.
Prevention
How can I reduce my risk of bibliophobia?
Because mental health professionals don’t fully understand the causes of bibliophobia, there’s no proven way to prevent it.
Many people with one specific fear have multiple phobias, plus other anxiety disorders such as panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It’s important to work with a healthcare provider to manage any symptoms of the first anxiety disorder before you develop additional fears.

Many children and adolescents grow out of bibliophobia, but the fear may last into adulthood. Although there’s no cure, therapy helps more than 90% of people who practice it regularly.
