When do people get palpitations?
You can get heart palpitations at different times in your life. Some people experience:

- Heart palpitations at night. These are just like daytime palpitations, but you may notice them more at night because you’re not busy or distracted.

Diagnosis and Tests
How are heart palpitations diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will listen to your heart and lungs. They’ll also review your:
- Medical history.
- Symptoms.
- Diet.
- Medications and herbal products you take.
It’s helpful to let a provider know the details of your heart palpitations, such as:
- When and how often they happen.
- How long they last.
- How you feel when they happen.
- What you’re doing when they start.
- What helps you feel better.
You may not have heart palpitations during your visit with a provider. They may ask you to tap your fingers to imitate the rhythm of your palpitations.
What tests will be done to diagnose heart palpitations?
A provider may order tests, such as:
- Blood tests.
- Urine (pee) tests.
- Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG).
- Stress test.
- Echocardiogram (heart ultrasound).
- A Holter monitor you wear for a day or longer to record your heart’s activity.
- Electrophysiology study.
- Cardiac catheterization.
You may need to see an electrophysiologist. This is a provider who specializes in abnormal heart rhythms.
Management and Treatment
How are heart palpitations treated?
The best type of treatment for you depends on what causes your heart palpitations. You may not need any treatment.
If you have heart disease or an abnormal heart rhythm, you may need medication, a procedure, surgery or a device to correct the problem. It’s important to keep all follow-up appointments with your provider.
How can I stop heart palpitations?
If anxiety or stress causes your heart palpitations, you may be able to control them with calming activities like yoga, meditation or a mindfulness exercise that focuses on your breathing. In addition, you may need to drink less coffee or other caffeinated drinks if caffeine triggers palpitations.
Will heart palpitations go away?
Heart palpitations often go away without medical treatment if things you eat, drink or do cause them, including:
- Smoking.
- Drinking alcohol.
- Drinking caffeinated beverages.
- Eating spicy or rich food.
- Working out too hard.
However, if you have heart disease or an abnormal heart rhythm, you may need medication, a procedure, surgery or a device to correct the issue. Again, it’s important to keep all follow-up appointments with your provider.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Heart palpitations (feeling like your heart is racing or pounding) can be unsettling because you usually aren’t aware of your heartbeat. But heart palpitations are usually harmless. If you have other symptoms like dizziness or passing out when you have heart palpitations, that could be a sign of a serious medical problem. In that case, you should tell a healthcare provider about it.
