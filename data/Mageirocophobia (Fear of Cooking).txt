Mageirocophobia (Fear of Cooking)
Overview
What is mageirocophobia?
Mageirocophobia is an extreme fear of cooking. It’s a specific phobia, meaning that it causes fear of a particular situation.
Mageirocophobia may stem from other mental health issues, including:
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), known for its repetitive thoughts and urges.
- Perfectionism, an expectation of flawlessness that, when not met, causes severe self-criticism.
This phobia may also stem from a fear of making mistakes. These mistakes can lead to:
- Fires: Stoves, ovens, microwaves and other kitchen appliances can cause fires. If there’s a grease fire, it can spread quickly and be difficult to put out.
- Food poisoning: Certain foods can make you sick if not fully cooked.
- Unappetizing food: Simple mistakes like cooking food too long can make it unpleasant to eat.
- Injuries: There’s a small risk of injury when using sharp objects.
- Stress: Cooking takes time and concentration, which can be difficult when you’re busy.
What are phobias?
It’s natural to fear things that feel dangerous or uncomfortable. Fires, sharp objects and the threat of severe illness give many people anxiety. But they rarely disrupt daily activities.
Phobias are more severe. They cause intense fear that makes you go out of your way to avoid certain situations. Phobias cause abnormal thoughts and behaviors that are difficult to control. These feelings can bring challenges to your everyday life.
What does mageirocophobia mean?
Many people feel anxious about preparing food, trying a new recipe or cooking for other people. With mageirocophobia, cooking or watching someone else cook can bring severe anxiety. Some people experience overwhelming symptoms that lead to panic attacks.
There’s no reason to feel self-conscious about possibly having a phobia. And there are therapies that can lessen its impact on your life. Talking to your healthcare provider can be one of the first steps toward getting better.
