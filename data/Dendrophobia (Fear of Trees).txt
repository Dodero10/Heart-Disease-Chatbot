They may refer you to a mental health professional who specializes in phobias and anxiety disorders.
Management and Treatment
What are dendrophobia treatments?
Exposure therapy is one of the main treatments for dendrophobia. During exposure therapy, your mental health professional exposes you to situations and images that may trigger your symptoms. They gradually help you manage your response. As many as 9 in 10 people with specific phobias see their symptoms improve after getting this type of psychotherapy (talk therapy).
During exposure therapy, you:
- Learn breathing and relaxation techniques to use before and during an exposure.
- View images or videos of trees.
- Gradually progress to imagining being beneath a tree in a garden, park or forest.
- Finally, look at or walk near a real tree outside.
What are other dendrophobia solutions?
Other techniques to overcome dendrophobia include:
- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT helps you learn to change how you see and respond to situations and objects that trigger symptoms. Many healthcare providers use CBT along with exposure therapy.
- Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT): This modified form of CBT teaches you how to live in the moment. It can help you cope with distress, maintain relationships with others and regulate emotions. You may have DBT in a group setting or one-on-one with a therapist.
- Hypnotherapy: Healthcare providers use guided relaxation techniques and focused attention to help alter your perception of trees. They can also use hypnotherapy to find the underlying cause of your tree anxiety.
- Medications: There isn’t a medication to treat dendrophobia. But some medications can help control panic attacks or treat mental health disorders. If you have depression or other mood disorders, talk to your healthcare provider about medications that might be right for you.
- Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR): This eight-week group program combines stress reduction and yoga. MBSR involves mindfulness meditation, which teaches you to relieve anxiety in the moment.
- Yoga and meditation: A regular yoga practice can help you relax and reduce your stress levels. Meditation can help you focus on your breathing to prevent panic attacks.

Severe dendrophobia can impact your quality of life. You may not want to go for walks outside or even drive your car. Just the thought of meeting friends or family at a park or outdoor social event can cause extreme anxiety. Since trees are nearly everywhere, you may stop wanting to leave your house at all.
Some people with dendrophobia have panic attacks. These attacks can lead to noncardiac chest pain, racing heart rate and heart attack symptoms. Constant worries about having panic attacks can lead to a panic disorder. This condition may require long-term use of anti-anxiety medications.
