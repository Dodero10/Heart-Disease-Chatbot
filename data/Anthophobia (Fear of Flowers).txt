Anthophobia (Fear of Flowers)
Overview
What is anthophobia?
People who have anthophobia have an extreme fear of flowers. “Anthos” is the Greek word for flowers, while phobia means fear. Someone with anthophobia may be afraid of any flower or a specific type. Any part of a flower or plant — from stem to leaf to petal — may cause fear.
What is a phobia?
Phobias are one of the most common anxiety disorders. A phobia causes you to have an extreme fear of something that’s unlikely to cause you harm. Anthophobia is a specific phobic disorder, which means you have a fear of a certain object — in this case, flowers.
How common is anthophobia?
It’s hard to know exactly how many people have a specific phobia, like anthophobia. Many people may keep this fear to themselves or may not recognize they have it. About 1 in 10 American adults and 1 in 5 teenagers will deal with a specific phobia disorder at some point in their lives.
Symptoms and Causes
Who is at risk for anthophobia?
Specific phobic disorders often develop in childhood. They typically affect more people designated female at birth (DFAB) than people designated male at birth (DMAB). Risk factors include:
- Family history: Having a parent or close relative with a phobia or anxiety disorder may increase your risk.
- Genetics: Experts believe some people have a gene change (gene mutation) that makes them more prone to anxiety disorders and phobias.
- Other phobias: It’s fairly common to have more than one phobia. These phobias are often related. For instance, a fear of insects (entomophobia), fear of spiders (arachnophobia) or fear of bees (apiphobia) may make you fearful of flowers where bugs are often found.
Why do I have a fear of plants?
Some people trace their fear of plants to a traumatic or negative experience. This event may occur during childhood.
For instance, you may associate flowers and plants with:
- Bee stings, tick bites or spider bites.
- Loss of a loved one and funerals.
- Severe allergies (hay fever).
What are anthophobia symptoms?
A person with a fear of flowers may experience physical symptoms of anxiety or panic when they think about flowers:
- Chills.
- Dizziness and lightheadedness.
- Excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis).
- Heart palpitations.
- Nausea.
- Shortness of breath (dyspnea).
- Trembling or shaking.
- Upset stomach or indigestion (dyspepsia).
Diagnosis and Tests
How is anthophobia diagnosed?
There are no tests to diagnose the fear of flowers. A healthcare provider can diagnose the condition based on discussions with you about:
- Your symptoms.
- How long they’ve been happening.
- How they interfere in your life.
For a diagnosis of anthophobia, a person’s fear must:
- Cause extreme anxiety.
- Lead to significant stress or affect your daily life.
- Have been happening for at least six months.
- Be out of proportion with any actual problems regarding your weight.
- Lead you to take unreasonable steps in an attempt to look, feel or be thin.
- Make you avoid specific situations that involve eating.
- Produce physical symptoms of anxiety or panic attacks.
Management and Treatment
How do you cure anthophobia?
More than 9 in 10 people who have specific phobias improve with exposure therapy, a form of psychotherapy (talk therapy). A mental health professional gradually exposes you to images and situations to help you overcome the fear of flowers.
During exposure therapy, your provider progressively guides you through these steps:
- Teaches relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises and meditation to use before and during exposure.
- Shows images or videos of flowers.
- Places flowers near you during therapy.
- Eventually, will have you hold flowers.
Therapists often combine exposure therapy with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This form of talk therapy helps you learn to change your perceptions and responses to situations that cause symptoms.
Medications like anti-anxiety drugs typically aren’t helpful for specific phobias. However, you may take medicine to help you get through certain situations — like attending a wedding that’s sure to have lots of flowers.
What are the complications of anthophobia?
Flowers and plants exist in a lot of places, both indoors and out. People who have an extreme fear of flowers may find it difficult to leave home, leading to agoraphobia. These phobias can affect your professional and social life.
Anthophobia may also increase your risk of:
- Depression.
- Panic attacks and panic disorder.
- Substance use disorder.
Living With
When should I call the doctor?
You should call your healthcare provider if you experience:
- Panic attacks.
- Persistent anxiety that interferes with daily life or sleeping.
- Signs of depression or problems with substances.
What questions should I ask my doctor?
You may want to ask your healthcare provider:
- What is causing this phobia?
- What is the best treatment for me?
- Should I try exposure therapy?
- How long will I need therapy?
- Can medications help?
- Should I watch for signs of complications?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
A fear of flowers can make it difficult for you to be out in society, working and socializing. It is extremely difficult to completely avoid flowers or plants. A mental health specialist can use exposure therapy, CBT or both to help you overcome anthophobia and any other related specific phobias.
