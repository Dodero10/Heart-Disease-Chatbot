Ombrophobia (Fear of Rain)
Overview
What is ombrophobia?
Ombrophobia is an extreme fear of rain. The condition is a specific phobia (fear), which is a type of anxiety disorder. A person who is afraid of rain (an ombrophobe) may be afraid of major, destructive rain or just a light drizzle.
People with ombrophobia may believe that rain can be harmful in some way. For example, they may worry about acid rain or germs in rainfall. They may have generalized fears that rain will cause darkness, floods, landslides, power failures or other dangers.
Ombrophobes may go to great lengths to avoid rain, such as:
- Deciding where to live based on local weather patterns.
- Obsessing over weather forecasts.
- Refusing to go outdoors.
- Skipping educational, professional or personal activities if there’s a chance rain might occur.
Any specific phobia, including ombrophobia, can cause significant stress and even physical symptoms. An ombrophobe may understand that the fear of rain is not reasonable but may not be able to control it.
How common is fear of rain?
Health professionals aren’t sure how common ombrophobia is. But one study found that about 10% of Americans have a fear of severe weather.
Phobias affect people of all ages. They can start in childhood or adulthood. Such fears are common: About 1 in 10 American adults and 1 in 5 teenagers will deal with a specific phobia disorder at some point in their lives.

What causes a fear of rain?
Healthcare providers aren’t sure what causes ombrophobia and other specific phobias. But mental health professionals believe it results from a combination of:
- Frightening experiences associated with rain: If a person has a traumatic experience with rain, that may lead to ombrophobia. For example, surviving a terrible storm or flood can make a person ombrophobic.
- Genetics: Some people have a family history of anxiety disorders and specific fears.

- Extreme feeling of dread or terror.
- Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
- Profuse sweating.

Diagnosis and Tests
How is ombrophobia diagnosed?
There are no tests to diagnose a rain phobia. A healthcare provider can diagnose the condition based on discussions with you about:
- Your symptoms and how long they’ve been happening.
- Whether symptoms interfere with your life.
A healthcare provider can diagnose ombrophobia if you have an intense fear of rain that:
- Causes extreme anxiety as soon as you think about rain, see it or feel it.
- Leads to significant stress or affects your daily life.
- Has been happening for at least six months.
- Is out of proportion with any actual danger.
- Makes you avoid the outdoors or certain activities.
- Produces physical symptoms of anxiety or panic attacks.
Management and Treatment
How do I get rid of ombrophobia?
Some people with mild ombrophobia may not need treatment. But if fear of rain leads to physical symptoms or interferes with your life, talk to a healthcare provider.
Possible treatments include:
- Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT is structured psychotherapy that can help a person understand and control thoughts and emotions. It’s a form of talk therapy, and it can help people unlearn negative thoughts and behaviors.
- Exposure therapy: Exposure therapy, sometimes called desensitization, helps people confront their fears gradually. Through increasing levels of exposure to rain, the person can learn to manage fear and negative reactions. For ombrophobia treatment, the therapist might start with something simple, like a picture of rain. Next, the therapist might ask the ombrophobe to imagine standing in the rain. Eventually, the therapist aims to have the person actually stand in the rain while controlling their emotions and behaviors.
- Hypnotherapy: Hypnotherapy can put a person in a trance-like but focused state. A person under hypnosis is more open to suggestions and change. A hypnotist may be able to convince a hypnotized person that they are less afraid of the rain.
- Medications: A variety of anti-anxiety medications can lessen anxiety and its physical symptoms.
Prevention
How can I reduce my risk of ombrophobia?
Mental health professionals don’t fully understand what causes a fear of rain, so they don’t have a proven way to prevent it.
But specific fears and anxiety issues often occur in groups. If you have another phobia or anxiety disorder, such as panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder, talk to a healthcare provider. Managing one anxiety disorder may help you prevent others.

Although there’s no cure for ombrophobia, treatments are very effective at lessening the effects.
