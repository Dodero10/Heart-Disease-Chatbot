Diagnosis and Tests
How is ailurophobia diagnosed?
If ailurophobia impacts your life, your healthcare provider may suggest that you see a mental health professional like a psychologist. A psychologist may diagnose you after asking about your symptoms.
You may have a specific phobic disorder if your fear of cats:
- Occurs when you think about or see cats.
- Leads you to skip situations such as going outside or to a friend’s house.
- Results in quick action, such as running away, if you see a cat.
- Causes you to miss out on social events.
- Affects your ability to enjoy life.
- Triggers symptoms of anxiety or fear that don’t match the actual danger.
- Lasts at least six months.
Management and Treatment
What are ailurophobia treatments?
Exposure therapy is one of the main treatments for ailurophobia. During exposure therapy, a mental health professional introduces you to situations and images that may trigger your symptoms. They gradually help you manage your response. As many as 9 in 10 people with specific phobias see their symptoms improve after getting this type of psychotherapy (talk therapy).
During exposure therapy, you:
- Learn breathing and relaxation techniques to use before and during an exposure.
- View pictures or videos of cats.
- Practice holding a toy cat.
- Gradually progress to being near a cat in a carrier.
- Finally, touch a cat while having support from a therapist, family or friends.
What are other ailurophobia solutions?
Other techniques to overcome ailurophobia include:
- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT helps you change how you see and respond to situations and objects that trigger symptoms. Many healthcare providers use CBT along with exposure therapy.
- Hypnotherapy: Providers use guided relaxation techniques and focused attention to help alter your perception of cats. Providers can also use hypnotherapy to find the underlying cause of your cat anxiety.
- Medications: Drugs that help with physical symptoms of anxiety, such as beta blockers or antianxiety medications, may reduce ailurophobia symptoms. Providers often prescribe these medications for situations where people may encounter a cat.
- Yoga and meditation: A consistent yoga practice can help you relax and decrease your stress levels. Meditation can help you focus on your breathing to reduce panic attacks.
What are the complications of ailurophobia?
Severe ailurophobia can impact your quality of life. You may not want to visit friends at their houses or go for walks outside. Just the thought of running into a cat when you leave your house can cause extreme anxiety. You may want to stop going out at all.
Some people with ailurophobia have panic attacks. These attacks can lead to chest pain or a racing heart rate. Persistent worries about panic attacks can result in a panic disorder. This condition may require long-term use of anti-anxiety medications.
