Atelophobia (Fear of Imperfection)
Overview
What is atelophobia?
Atelophobia is an overwhelming fear of imperfection. People with atelophobia judge themselves very harshly, often setting unrealistic goals. They may get upset about mistakes they’ve made in the past or mistakes they’re afraid of making in the future. Atelophobia often leads to extreme anxiety, depression, low self-esteem or panic attacks.
Atelophobia is different than atychiphobia, which is a fear of failure.
Are atelophobia and perfectionism the same?
Atelophobia and perfectionism are different. Perfectionism is a personality trait. You hold yourself to extremely high standards and strive to be flawless. Atelophobia is an actual fear of flaws. Someone with atelophobia may avoid a situation in which they think they could make a mistake, seeing it as threatening. The fear can affect every aspect of their lives, from school and work to family life and social situations.

There are few studies about the prevalence of atelophobia, but phobic disorders are fairly common. Research suggests that about 12% of adults and 19% of adolescents in the U.S. experience a specific phobia at some point in their lives. They’re about twice as common in females as they are in males.

Diagnosis and Tests
How is atelophobia diagnosed?
There’s no specific test for atelophobia. Your healthcare provider will evaluate your symptoms and ask you detailed questions about your fear of imperfection. It’s important to provide as much detail as possible about your anxiety and what triggers it. In some cases, your provider will ask about your medical history, perform a complete physical and may order other tests to check for underlying health conditions.
Your provider may diagnose you with atelophobia if you:
- Avoid situations in which you could make a mistake or not perform at your best.
- Experience symptoms for six months or longer.
- Have severe anxiety at the thought of making a mistake or disappointing others.
- Have trouble at home, work or school due to your fear of imperfection.
People with atelophobia may also have other mental health conditions, such as
- Avoidant personality disorder.
- Illness anxiety disorder (hypochondriasis).
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder.
- Panic disorder.
- Paranoid personality disorder.
- Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
- Substance abuse disorders such as drug addiction or alcohol use disorder.
Management and Treatment
How is atelophobia managed or treated?
There are a variety of ways to manage a fear of imperfection, including:
- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT focuses on helping you change the way you think about imperfection. You may explore the reasons why you see mistakes as negative experiences rather than learning experiences. A therapist teaches you to identify the specific triggers that cause your anxiety.
- Exposure therapy: You work on desensitizing yourself to the fear of imperfections. After identifying your triggers with CBT, you expose yourself to the triggers and learn how to cope with them in safe, healthy ways.
- Lifestyle modifications: A healthy diet and regular exercise can help improve your mood and diminish feelings of depression or negative thinking. Deep breathing, yoga or meditation may help you manage anxiety and keep panic attacks at bay.
- Medication: The medication doesn’t treat the source of your fear. But it may reduce the symptoms of depression or anxiety that accompany atelophobia. Your healthcare provider may recommend antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, sedatives or beta-blockers.
Prevention
Is there a way to prevent atelophobia?
There’s no way to prevent atelophobia, but you can take steps to reduce the negative effects it has on your life. You may benefit from:
- Creating a strong support system of friends and family members.
- Not consuming caffeine, recreational drugs or alcohol, which can make anxiety worse.
- Sharing your fears and concerns with a therapist or other healthcare provider.
Outlook / Prognosis
What’s the prognosis (outlook) for people with atelophobia?
