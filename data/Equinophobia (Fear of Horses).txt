Diagnosis and Tests
How is equinophobia diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will assess your symptoms and ask about previous experiences with horses. You may see a mental health professional like a psychologist. To diagnose a specific phobic disorder, providers refer to the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (the DSM-5).
You may have a specific phobic disorder like equinophobia if you have:
- Phobia symptoms when you see or think about horses.
- Persistent fear of horses that lasts for at least six months.
- Ever changed your routines or behaviors to avoid seeing or being near horses.
- Diminished quality of life due to phobia symptoms.
Management and Treatment
How can you get over a fear of horses?
A psychologist or other mental health specialist can help you overcome a fear of horses. You may benefit from one or more of these treatments:
- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): A provider uses psychotherapy (talk therapy) to help you explore the underlying cause of the phobia. With CBT, you learn how to use relaxation techniques to manage phobia symptoms and overcome your fear.
- Exposure therapy: You use relaxation techniques while a provider gradually exposes you to images of horses. You may work your way up to being near a horse and then touching a horse. Exposure therapy makes you less sensitive or responsive to your fear. This therapy is also called desensitization.
- Hypnotherapy: Hypnotherapy puts you into a hypnotic state, or trance, to help you overcome thoughts and emotions related to horses.
- Medications: As you go through therapy, anti-anxiety drugs or antidepressants can ease symptoms. These medicines can make it easier for you to be around horses until you finish therapy.
What are the complications of equinophobia?
A severe phobic disorder increases your risk of:
- Depression, social isolation and suicidal thoughts.
- Panic attacks and panic disorder.
- Substance use disorder.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
Depending on where you live and the types of activities you enjoy, it may be easy or difficult to avoid seeing horses. But even in cities, police officers often patrol on horseback and horses may take tourists around to see the sights. Because having a phobia increases your risk for other phobias, anxiety disorder and panic attacks, it’s best to seek help to overcome this fear. Psychotherapies, including CBT and exposure therapy, can make it easier for you to be around horses.
