Coagulative Necrosis
Overview
What is coagulative necrosis?
Coagulative necrosis occurs when cells die due to a lack of blood supply. Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to your cells. When blood flow slows or stops, cells can no longer function.
Where does coagulative necrosis occur?
Coagulative necrosis can occur anywhere in your body except your brain.
What happens to cells after they die?
In coagulative necrosis, cells and tissues maintain their structure after death. Eventually, your immune system clears the dead cells away.
How is coagulative necrosis used as a cancer treatment?
Some cancer treatments induce coagulative necrosis through heat or cold. Minimally invasive therapies, such as ablation therapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), apply heat and cold to cancer cells to destroy them.
Symptoms and Causes
What causes coagulative necrosis?
Many conditions can cause coagulative necrosis in different areas of your body. One example in which coagulative necrosis occurs is a heart attack (myocardial infarction). During a heart attack, one or more coronary arteries that carry blood to your heart become blocked. Without blood flow, heart muscle cells die and the heart may stop pumping. A heart attack can cause permanent heart damage or death if not treated quickly.
Restriction of blood flow to other organs, such as your kidneys, spleen, liver and intestines, can also occur. Causes of this may include:
- Atherosclerosis.
- Blood clots.
- Hernias.
- Infections.
- Injuries or trauma.
Cancer can also cause coagulative necrosis. When a tumor grows quickly, it can outgrow its blood supply, creating areas of dead cancer cells (coagulative tumor cell necrosis). This is a sign of a more aggressive cancer.
What are the symptoms of coagulative necrosis?
Coagulative necrosis may affect the function of the organ where it occurred. Symptoms depend on the location and severity of the damage.
After a heart attack, damaged heart muscle tissue doesn’t regenerate and scar tissue forms. Scarring may impact how your heart functions and can lead to other problems, such as:
- Abnormal heartbeat.
- Heart failure.
- Kidney disease.
- Stroke.
Talk to your provider about symptoms you need to watch out for to catch any recurring or new problems early.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is coagulative necrosis diagnosed?
A sample of tissue examined under a microscope (biopsy) will show areas of coagulative necrosis. However, it’s usually more important to assess the function of the affected organ.
For your heart, your provider will use heart scans to evaluate how it’s working. These include:
- Cardiac CT.
- Echocardiogram.
- MRI.
Management and Treatment
How is coagulative necrosis treated?
Treatment for coagulative necrosis centers on preventing further damage and supporting organ function.
After a heart attack, healthcare providers initially focus on restoring blood flow to your heart, if possible. They also work to reestablish normal heart function. Longer term, your provider may prescribe medications to:
- Control high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors).
- Lower cholesterol (statins).
- Prevent blood clots (antithrombotic therapy).
- Reduce the stress on your heart (beta-blockers).
Your provider will also recommend lifestyle modifications to improve your heart health, such as:
- Controlling diabetes.
- Eating a heart-healthy diet.
- Lowering your stress levels.
- Maintaining a healthy weight.
- Reducing alcohol intake.
- Quitting smoking.
Prevention
How can I prevent coagulative necrosis?
You can prevent coagulative necrosis by maintaining good overall health. If you have underlying medical conditions, work with your provider to manage them and reduce your risk of complications.
Outlook / Prognosis
What is the prognosis for people with coagulative necrosis?
The prognosis, or outlook, depends on how extensive the tissue damage is.
Living With
When should I contact my healthcare provider?
If you’ve experienced a heart attack or other condition that resulted in organ damage, ongoing medical care is essential. Follow your provider’s instructions and take your medications as directed to manage your condition and prevent further problems.
When should I call 911?
A heart attack is an emergency. Its symptoms include:
- Pressure, pain or discomfort in your chest.
- Shortness of breath.
- Pain in the jaw, upper back or down the arms.
If you suspect you or someone you’re with is experiencing a heart attack, call 911 (or your local emergency services phone number) immediately. Time is critical in treating a heart attack. Even a few minutes’ delay can lead to permanent damage or death.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Coagulative necrosis happens when there’s a lack of blood supply to your cells and tissues. Routine visits to your healthcare provider can help you prevent conditions that could lead to coagulative necrosis and maintain your overall health. If you have underlying conditions, close follow-up care is key to managing your health and avoiding future complications.
