Buerger’s Disease
Overview
What is Buerger’s disease?
Buerger’s disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) is a rare disease of the blood vessels in your arms, legs, fingers and toes. Inflammation in your blood vessels makes it hard for your blood to flow through them. Blood clots can form, which create obstacles inside your blood vessels. As a result, you can have pain and damaged tissues starting in your fingers and toes and spreading to your arms and legs.
How common is Buerger’s disease?
With fewer people smoking, Buerger’s disease is rare. Out of every 100,000 people in America, only 12 to 20 people have it. Other countries with more tobacco use have more cases of Buerger’s disease.

About 50% of the people with Buerger’s disease who keep using tobacco end up needing to have a finger or toe removed (amputation). People with Buerger’s disease who quit smoking hardly ever need an amputation.

- Can you help me quit smoking?

Additional Common Questions
What’s the difference between Buerger’s disease and Raynaud’s disease?
Raynaud’s disease or syndrome can be a symptom of Buerger’s disease. With Raynaud’s disease, the blood vessels in your toes and fingers collapse because you’re feeling cold or you’re under stress. The lack of enough blood getting through your blood vessels makes your skin look white or blue. After a few minutes or hours, your skin looks red and can feel numb or tingly.
Simply warming up your hands, wearing gloves or wearing warm socks can help relieve the symptoms. Buerger’s disease is painful and has many more symptoms than Raynaud’s disease.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Buerger’s disease is a rare issue with the blood vessels in your fingers, toes, arms and legs. While you can take medicines for your symptoms, the best treatment for Buerger’s disease is to quit smoking. Most people with Buerger’s disease get relief from their symptoms when they stop smoking. Ask your provider to help you quit smoking so you can feel better.
