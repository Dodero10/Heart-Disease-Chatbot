Diagnosis and Tests
How is agoraphobia diagnosed?
If you think you have agoraphobia, and the anxiety is interfering with your daily life, you should talk to a primary care physician or a mental healthcare provider, like a psychiatrist or psychologist. If you’re afraid to visit a medical office in person, you may be able to schedule a telephone or video appointment.
The healthcare provider may ask you:
- Do you get stressed about leaving your house?
- Are there any places or situations you avoid because you’re afraid? Why does it cause fear?
- Do you rely on others to do your shopping and errands?
A healthcare provider can diagnose agoraphobia based on your symptoms, how often they happen and how severe they are. It’s important to be open and honest with your providers. Your provider may diagnose agoraphobia if you meet specific standards developed by the American Psychiatric Association. To have a diagnosis of agoraphobia, a person must feel extreme fear or panic in at least two of the following situations:
- Using public transportation.
- Being in an open space.
- Being in an enclosed space, such as a movie theater, meeting room or small store.
- Standing in a line or being in a crowd.
- Being out of their home alone.
Management and Treatment
How is agoraphobia treated?
Agoraphobia treatment usually involves a combination of treatment methods:
- Psychotherapy (talk therapy).
- Medication.
- Lifestyle changes.
Psychotherapy
A therapist can help you work through your fears. Using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a mental healthcare provider can help you recognize thoughts that cause you anxiety. Then, you’ll learn ways to react more productively.
Using relaxation and desensitization techniques, your provider may have you imagine a scary situation and manage the feelings. Eventually, you’ll be able to take part in activities that produce anxiety, and you’ll know how to manage your emotions. Over time, therapy can train your brain to think and respond differently.
Medications
Your healthcare provider also may suggest medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). These medications can treat depression and anxiety disorders.
Lifestyle changes
The following lifestyle changes may also help you manage agoraphobia:
- Avoid alcohol, caffeine and other substances.
- Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet.
- Exercise regularly.
- Practice breathing exercises.
Living With
How can I learn to cope with agoraphobia?
