Diagnosis and Tests
How is entomophobia diagnosed?
If entomophobia affects your life, your healthcare provider may suggest that you see a mental health professional like a psychologist. The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) doesn’t recognize entomophobia as a phobic disorder. But a psychologist may diagnose you after asking about your symptoms.
You may have a specific phobic disorder if the fear of insects:
- Occurs when you think about or see insects.
- Leads you to skip situations like going to a park or for a hike.
- Causes you to miss out on social events.
- Affects your ability to enjoy life.
- Triggers symptoms of anxiety or fear that don’t match the actual danger.
- Lasts at least six months.
Management and Treatment
What are entomophobia treatments?
Exposure therapy is one of the main treatments for entomophobia. During exposure therapy, a mental health professional introduces you to situations and images that may trigger your symptoms. They gradually help you manage your response. Most people with specific phobias see their symptoms improve after getting this type of psychotherapy (talk therapy).
During exposure therapy, your provider helps you:
- Learn relaxation and breathing techniques to use before and during an exposure.
- Talk about your fear of insects.
- View pictures or videos of insects.
- See live insects in a controlled setting, such as at your healthcare provider’s office.
- Gradually progress to a situation where you may see insects, such as a park or forest.
What are other entomophobia solutions?
Other techniques to overcome entomophobia include:
- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT helps you change how you see and react to objects and situations that trigger symptoms. Many healthcare providers use CBT along with exposure therapy.
- Hypnotherapy: Providers use guided relaxation techniques and focused attention to help alter your perception of insects. Providers can also use hypnotherapy to find the underlying cause of your insect fear.
- Medications: Drugs that help with physical symptoms of anxiety may temporarily lessen entomophobia symptoms in certain situations. Antidepressants can also help reduce overall anxiety.
- Yoga and meditation: A regular yoga practice can help you relax and reduce your stress levels. Meditation helps you focus on your breathing and calm your body to lessen panic attacks.
What are the complications of entomophobia?
Severe entomophobia can have a huge impact on your day-to-day life. You may not want to walk outside, meet friends in a park or take your kids to a playground. Just thinking about seeing an insect when you leave your house can cause extreme anxiety. You may decide to stop going out of your house at all.
Some people with entomophobia have panic attacks. These attacks can lead to a racing heart rate and noncardiac chest pain or heart attack symptoms. Uncontrolled panic attacks and constant worry can lead to a panic disorder.
