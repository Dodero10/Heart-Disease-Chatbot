Microphobia (Fear of Small Things)
Overview
What is microphobia?
Microphobia is an extreme fear of small things. It’s a specific phobia, meaning that it causes fear of a particular situation. The fear is typically much greater than the actual risk of danger. People can have more than one specific phobia. In addition to microphobia, they might have:
- Entomophobia: Fear of insects.
- Iatrophobia: Fear of doctors.
- Mysophobia: Fear of germs.
- Nosocomephobia: Fear of hospitals.
- Nosophobia: Fear of disease.
- Thanatophobia: Fear of death.
What is a phobia?
It’s natural to fear things that make you feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Blood, heights and airplanes give many people anxiety. But their anxiety isn’t usually so intense that it disrupts their daily lives. Phobias are intense feelings of fear. When you have a phobia, you may go out of your way to avoid situations that trigger it. These efforts can overtake rational thinking, leading to abnormal thoughts and behaviors.
Do I have microphobia?
Little things are a part of everyday life. Most of them cause no harm. But in some people, they cause a level of fear that’s out of proportion to the actual threat. If you have microphobia, the thought of little things can bring on severe anxiety. It can sometimes cause panic attacks. If you have signs of microphobia, discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider. There’s no reason to feel self-conscious about having a phobia. Treatments can help you feel better. And your healthcare provider can help you receive the therapies that are best for your needs.

A common treatment for microphobia is exposure therapy. Your therapist exposes you to situations that trigger your fear of little things. Exposure therapy for microphobia may start with pictures of germs or other small objects.

If you’re anxious about going back out in public again, where you might encounter little things, medications may help ease the transition.
