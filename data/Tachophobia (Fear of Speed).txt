Tachophobia (Fear of Speed)
Overview
What is tachophobia?
Tachophobia is the irrational fear of speed. People with tachophobia are afraid of moving at a quick pace. They may fear riding roller coasters, driving, biking or even walking too fast.
Some people with tachophobia may avoid quick-moving transit at all costs. For example, they may refuse to ride airplanes, buses or trains. In some cases, people may refuse to leave their homes for fear of encountering a fast-moving car or bus.
Tachophobia is a type of specific phobia. A specific phobia is an overwhelming fear of something that isn’t actually a significant threat. Many people who have specific phobias know the fear is irrational. But it can still be challenging to control symptoms.
Who might get tachophobia?
Tachophobia can be related to other fears, such as the fear of driving (amaxophobia). Or people may have a fear of dying in a speeding vehicle. You’re more likely to develop tachophobia if you have:
- Family history of tachophobia.
- Family member who has an anxiety disorder.
- Negative past experiences with moving fast, such as being in a car accident.
How common is tachophobia?
Experts don’t know exactly how many people have tachophobia. In general, about 12.5% of adults in the United States deal with a specific phobia at some point in their life. Women are about twice as likely as men to have a specific phobia.
Symptoms and Causes
What causes tachophobia?
Often, tachophobia stems from a past trauma associated with moving quickly. For example, you might have a loved one who died in a plane crash. Or you may have been in a severe car accident.
People with a personal or family history of anxiety disorders are more likely to develop specific phobias. Sometimes, the cause of tachophobia is a combination of genetics and negative experiences.
What are the symptoms of tachophobia?
The main symptom of tachophobia is irrational fear when moving quickly or observing fast motion. People with tachophobia may even feel afraid while watching sports or fast sequences in action movies.
They may choose to live within walking distance of work or a grocery store. They often avoid driving or taking public transportation. But avoiding fast speeds can make tachophobia symptoms worse because it reinforces the thought that the fear is justified.
Extreme anxiety can also cause physical symptoms, such as:
- Chest pain.
- Dizziness or fainting (syncope).
- Heart palpitations or a racing heartbeat.
- Nausea or vomiting.
- Shortness of breath (dyspnea).
- Sweating.
- Trembling or uncontrollable shaking.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is tachophobia diagnosed?
To diagnose or rule out tachophobia, your healthcare provider may ask you specific questions about symptoms. Sometimes, anxiety symptoms relate to another mental health condition.
Your healthcare provider may ask if you have experienced:
- Extreme avoidance of swift-moving vehicles.
- Fear or anxiety lasting six months or longer.
- Immediate distress or dread when you think about moving at fast speeds.
- Panic that’s severe compared with the actual threat of speed.
- Symptoms that interfere with your usual functioning or daily routine.
Management and Treatment
How is tachophobia treated?
Tachophobia treatment may be similar to treatment approaches for other specific phobias. Your healthcare provider may recommend these treatments:
- Exposure therapy is successful for up to 9 out of 10 people who do it as directed. It’s often the only specific phobia treatment you need. Exposure therapy involves gradually introducing the specific fear into your life. You may imagine moving at faster speeds, eventually working up to activities like riding a bus or driving a car.
- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) involves talking with a therapist about symptoms. Your therapist helps you identify thought patterns that are untrue or irrational. The goal of CBT is to retrain your brain to redirect these thought patterns.
- Hypnotherapy involves a state of intense concentration in which you’re temporarily unaware of your surroundings. While you’re in this state, your therapist may talk with you about symptoms and suggest treatments. Hypnotherapy often increases the success of other phobia treatments, such as exposure therapy.
- Medications may be especially useful if you have an anxiety disorder. For example, your healthcare provider may prescribe diazepam (Valium®) or alprazolam (Xanax®). You may take these medicines before travel or other typically stressful events.
Prevention
How can I prevent tachophobia?
There’s no guaranteed way to prevent tachophobia. But you may manage or lessen anxiety symptoms by living a healthy lifestyle, such as:
- Connect with loved ones regularly to lower your risk of social withdrawal and isolation.
- Eat a nutritious diet of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein and healthy fat.
- Exercise consistently, incorporating both aerobic exercise and strength training.
- Reduce stress with healthy coping strategies such as mindfulness or meditation.
- Sleep at least seven to eight hours each night.
Outlook / Prognosis
Are there long-term effects of tachophobia?
With treatment, many people manage tachophobia symptoms so they don’t interfere with daily life. Without treatment, specific phobias can increase your risk of:
- Mood disorders such as depression or anxiety.
- Social withdrawal and isolation.
- Substance misuse, including addiction to drugs or alcohol.
Living With
What else should I ask my healthcare provider?
You may want to ask your healthcare provider:
- What’s the most likely cause of a specific phobia?
- What are the treatment options for tachophobia?
- What could happen if I don’t seek treatment?
- Can I overcome tachophobia completely?
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Tachophobia is the irrational fear of speed. People with tachophobia might be afraid to drive a car, ride public transportation or even look at fast-moving vehicles. They might choose to live only in places where they can walk to work or do errands. Treatment might include exposure therapy, CBT or medication. Living a healthy lifestyle can also decrease the frequency and intensity of symptoms.
