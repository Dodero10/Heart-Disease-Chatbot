- Germophobia.
- Verminophobia.
What are phobias?
It’s natural to fear situations that seem dangerous or uncomfortable. You may also get anxious about things that can affect your well-being, like foods that make you sick. But these situations rarely disrupt daily activities. Phobias cause more intense feelings. Phobias cause abnormal thoughts and behaviors that are difficult to control.
Do I have mysophobia?
When living with mysophobia, you’re constantly worried about germs. You may go out of your way to avoid:
- Contact with other people’s body fluids.
- Dirt, dust, mold and other substances associated with germs.
- Contaminated food.
- Items and surfaces when you don’t know whether they’re clean.
What are some other mysophobia facts?
Mysophobia is a specific phobia, meaning that it’s due to a particular situation. People with mysophobia may also suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). People with OCD take comfort in repetitive, irrational thoughts and urges.

Management and Treatment
How can I overcome mysophobia?
A common mysophobia treatment is exposure therapy. Working with your mental health provider, you explore the reasons behind your fear of germs. This is the first step in overcoming mysophobia. When you feel comfortable, your therapist gradually exposes you to situations where germs may be present.
Therapy starts with low-risk exposures, such as thinking about germs. As you progress through treatment, exposures become more significant. You may touch unsanitized objects or start spending more time in public places. With successful treatment, you learn how to manage negative thoughts and feelings.
Can other treatments help me cope with mysophobia?
Additional treatments may include:
- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): Undergoing CBT helps you address why germs make you uncomfortable. You also learn methods for regaining control when these thoughts get overwhelming.
- Medications: Drugs don’t cure mysophobia. But antidepressants can help with mood disorders, and anti-anxiety medications may help you cope in a stressful situation. If you’re anxious about going out in public, medications may help.
- Stress reduction: Yoga, meditation and other relaxation techniques quiet an overactive mind. This can make it easier to think positive thoughts instead of always bracing for the worst.

If you have anxiety or OCD, it’s important to find healthy ways of managing your thoughts and reactions to germs. Doing so may lower the risk of these situations escalating into a phobia.
It’s also possible to lower the risk of mysophobia by taking good care of your mental health. You can do this by:
- Limiting alcohol and recreational drug consumption.
- Lowering stress during everyday activities.
- Quitting smoking and other forms of tobacco use.
- Spending time with loved ones.
