Pediatric Somatic Symptom Disorder
Overview
What is somatic symptom disorder?
Somatic symptom disorder is a condition that occurs when your child feels emotional distress as physical distress. Several things can contribute to somatization, including sleep patterns, nutritional intake, stress, anxiety, hydration and others. Symptoms may worsen due to excessive worry or negative thoughts and behaviors related to their physical symptoms.
Physical symptoms are very common in children, with as many as 10% of children reporting pain or worry per day. These symptoms are biological and aren’t voluntary or “fake.” Your child may feel extremely distressed about their symptoms and it may interfere with their daily activities and prevent them from going to school or spending time with their peers.
Is somatic symptom disorder the same as illness anxiety disorder?
No. Somatic symptom disorder is different from hypochondria and illness anxiety disorder.
Somatic symptom disorder is emotional distress that causes a child to feel physical symptoms like pain. Medical testing can’t confirm or explain these symptoms in your child but they aren’t fake symptoms. A diagnosis is made by a doctor based on patterns of symptoms.
Illness anxiety disorder causes your child to have a fear that they have or are at a high risk of getting a serious medical condition. Children misinterpret normal body functions as signs of an illness. Children with illness anxiety disorder can be care-seeking, where they want to spend a lot of time in a healthcare setting, or are care-avoidant, where they don’t trust doctors or healthcare providers.

- Chronic fatigue.
How common is somatic symptom disorder?

Management and Treatment
How is somatic symptom disorder treated?
The goal of treating a somatic symptom disorder is to manage symptoms using behavioral therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy (talk therapy) that helps children learn ways to change their patterns of thinking or behaviors to change the way they feel. CBT helps children better cope with situations, anxiety and stress, and respond to situations more effectively.
Your child’s providers will focus on treating anxiety and negative patterns of thinking rather than invasive treatment methods like surgery or prescribing high doses of pain medication.
How soon after treatment will my child feel better?
Most children, with parental support of the diagnosis and treatment plan, can resolve symptoms. Somatic symptom disorder isn’t a disease and isn’t lifelong with appropriate treatment. Your child’s healthcare team will work together to help them cope with their anxieties to reduce the amount of physical discomfort they feel over time.
Prevention
How can I prevent somatic symptom disorder?
If your child begins to show signs of anxiety or depression that affect their way of life and their ability to thrive, meet with their healthcare provider and/or a mental health professional. Your child’s symptoms won’t go away immediately. Stick with your child’s treatment plan and regularly visit their healthcare providers to monitor their treatment progress. While they may go through periods where they don’t show improvement of symptoms, patience and consistency of treatment are key to their success in preventing the condition from continuing.
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have somatic symptom disorder?
With CBT treatment, children with a somatic symptom disorder have a good outlook (prognosis). Somatic symptom disorder isn’t necessarily a chronic condition, but treatment is available to help your child manage their emotional distress related to their physical health. The primary goal of treatment is for your child to return to typical functioning, including attending school and engaging in typically enjoyed activities.
